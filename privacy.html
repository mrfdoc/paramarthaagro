            &quot;Service&quot;) and any of its related products and services (collectively, &quot;Services&quot;) is
            collected, protected and used. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your
            Personal
            Information and how you can access and update this information. This Policy is a legally binding agreement
            between you (&quot;User&quot;, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;your&quot;) and this Website operator
            (&quot;Operator&quot;, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot; or &quot;our&quot;). By accessing and using the
            Website
            and Services, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this
            Agreement. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to
            individuals that we do not employ or manage.</p>
          <h2>Automatic collection of information</h2>
          <p>When you open the Website, our servers automatically record information that your browser sends. This data
            may
            include information such as your device's IP address, browser type and version, operating system type and
            version, language preferences or the webpage you were visiting before you came to the Website and Services,
            pages of the Website and Services that you visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for
            on
            the Website, access times and dates, and other statistics.</p>
          <p>Information collected automatically is used only to identify potential cases of abuse and establish
            statistical
            information regarding the usage and traffic of the Website and Services. This statistical information is not
            otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any particular user of the system.</p>
          <h2>Collection of personal information</h2>
          <p>You can access and use the Website and Services without telling us who you are or revealing any information
            by
            which someone could identify you as a specific, identifiable individual. If, however, you wish to use some
            of
            the features on the Website, you may be asked to provide certain Personal Information (for example, your
            name
            and e-mail address). We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us when you fill any
            online
            forms on the Website. When required, this information may include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Personal details such as name, country of residence, etc.</li>
            <li>Contact information such as email address, address, etc.</li>
            <li>Geolocation data such as latitude and longitude.</li>
            <li>Any other materials you willingly submit to us such as articles, images, feedback, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some of the information we collect is directly from you via the Website and Services. However, we may also
            collect Personal Information about you from other sources such as public databases and our joint marketing
            partners. You can choose not to provide us with your Personal Information, but then you may not be able to
            take
            advantage of some of the features on the Website. Users who are uncertain about what information is
            mandatory
            are welcome to contact us.</p>
          <h2>Use and processing of collected information</h2>
          <p>In order to make the Website and Services available to you, or to meet a legal obligation, we need to
            collect
            and use certain Personal Information. If you do not provide the information that we request, we may not be
            able
            to provide you with the requested products or services. Any of the information we collect from you may be
            used
            for the following purposes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
            <li>Send administrative information</li>
            <li>Respond to inquiries and offer support</li>
            <li>Improve user experience</li>
            <li>Protect from abuse and malicious users</li>
            <li>Respond to legal requests and prevent harm</li>
            <li>Run and operate the Website and Services</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Processing your Personal Information depends on how you interact with the Website and Services, where you
            are
            located in the world and if one of the following applies: (i) you have given your consent for one or more
            specific purposes; this, however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject
            to
            California Consumer Privacy Act or European data protection law; (ii) provision of information is necessary
            for
            the performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (iii)
            processing is
            necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) processing is related to a
            task
            that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us; (v)
            processing
            is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.</p>
          <p> Note that under some legislations we may be allowed to process information until you object to such
            processing
            (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases below. In any
            case,
            we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
            whether
            the provision of Personal Information is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary
            to
            enter into a contract.</p>
          <h2>Disclosure of information</h2>
          <p> Depending on the requested Services or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any service you
            have requested, we may share your information with your consent with our trusted third parties that work
            with
            us, any other affiliates and subsidiaries we rely upon to assist in the operation of the Website and
            Services
            available to you. We do not share Personal Information with unaffiliated third parties. These service
            providers
            are not authorized to use or disclose your information except as necessary to perform services on our behalf
            or
            comply with legal requirements. We may share your Personal Information for these purposes only with third
            parties whose privacy policies are consistent with ours or who agree to abide by our policies with respect
            to
            Personal Information. These third parties are given Personal Information they need only in order to perform
            their designated functions, and we do not authorize them to use or disclose Personal Information for their
            own
            marketing or other purposes.</p>
          <p>We will disclose any Personal Information we collect, use or receive if required or permitted by law, such
            as
            to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process, and when we believe in good faith that disclosure is
            necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond
            to a
            government request.</p>
          <h2>Retention of information</h2>
          <p>We will retain and use your Personal Information for the period necessary to comply with our legal
            obligations,
            resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by
            law.
            We may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your Personal Information after you update or
            delete it, but not in a manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period expires,
            Personal
            Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right to access, the right to erasure, the right to
            rectification
            and the right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of the retention period.</p>
          <h2>Transfer of information</h2>
          <p>Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring and storing your information in a
            country
            other than your own. You are entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a country
            outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set
            up
            by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by us to safeguard your
            information. If any such transfer takes place, you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of
            this
            Policy or inquire with us using the information provided in the contact section.</p>
          <h2>The rights of users</h2>
          <p>You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed by us. In particular, you have the
            right
            to do the following: (i) you have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given your consent
            to
            the processing of your information; (ii) you have the right to object to the processing of your information
            if
            the processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii) you have the right to learn if
            information is being processed by us, obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and
            obtain a
            copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have the right to verify the accuracy of your
            information and ask for it to be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain circumstances,
            to
            restrict the processing of your information, in which case, we will not process your information for any
            purpose
            other than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances, to obtain the erasure of your
            Personal Information from us; (vii) you have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly
            used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller
            without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated
            means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of or on
            pre-contractual obligations thereof.</p>
          <h2>The right to object to processing</h2>
          <p>Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority
            vested in us or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such
            processing by
            providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection.</p>
          <h2>Data protection rights under GDPR</h2>
          <p>If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights and the
            Operator aims to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or limit the use of your
            Personal
            Information. If you wish to be informed what Personal Information we hold about you and if you want it to be
            removed from our systems, please contact us. In certain circumstances, you have the following data
            protection
            rights:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>You have the right to request access to your Personal Information that we store and have the ability to
              access your Personal Information.</li>
            <li>You have the right to request that we correct any Personal Information you believe is inaccurate. You
              also
              have the right to request us to complete the Personal Information you believe is incomplete.</li>
            <li>You have the right to request the erase your Personal Information under certain conditions of this
              Policy.
            </li>
            <li>You have the right to object to our processing of your Personal Information.</li>
            <li> You have the right to seek restrictions on the processing of your Personal Information. When you
              restrict
              the processing of your Personal Information, we may store it but will not process it further.</li>
            <li> You have the right to be provided with a copy of the information we have on you in a structured,
              machine-readable and commonly used format.</li>
            <li> You also have the right to withdraw your consent at any time where the Operator relied on your consent
              to
              process your Personal Information.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>You have the right to complain to a Data Protection Authority about our collection and use of your Personal
            Information. For more information, please contact your local data protection authority in the European
            Economic
            Area (EEA).</p>
          <h2>California privacy rights</h2>
          <p>In addition to the rights as explained in this Policy, California residents who provide Personal
            Information
            (as defined in the statute) to obtain products or services for personal, family, or household use are
            entitled
            to request and obtain from us, once a calendar year, information about the Personal Information we shared,
            if
            any, with other businesses for marketing uses. If applicable, this information would include the categories
            of
            Personal Information and the names and addresses of those businesses with which we shared such personal
            information for the immediately prior calendar year (e.g., requests made in the current year will receive
            information about the prior year). To obtain this information please contact us.</p>
          <h2>How to exercise these rights</h2>
          <p>Any requests to exercise your rights can be directed to the Operator through the contact details provided
            in
            this document. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity before responding to such requests.
            Your
            request must provide sufficient information that allows us to verify that you are the person you are
            claiming to
            be or that you are the authorized representative of such person. You must include sufficient details to
            allow us
            to properly understand the request and respond to it. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with
            Personal Information unless we first verify your identity or authority to make such a request and confirm
            that
            the Personal Information relates to you.</p>
          <h2>Privacy of children</h2>
          <p>We do not knowingly collect any Personal Information from children under the age of 18. If you are under
            the
            age of 18, please do not submit any Personal Information through the Website and Services. We encourage
            parents
            and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by
            instructing
            their children never to provide Personal Information through the Website and Services without their
            permission.
            If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 18 has provided Personal Information to us
            through
            the Website and Services, please contact us. You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the
            processing of your Personal Information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or
            guardian
            to do so on your behalf).</p>
          <h2>Do Not Track signals</h2>
          <p>Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to websites you visit that you do not want to
            have your online activity tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information in connection
            with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to collecting personally identifiable information from
            consumers who use or visit a website or online service as they move across different websites over time. The
            Website and Services do not track its visitors over time and across third party websites. However, some
            third
            party sites may keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to
            tailor
            what they present to you.</p>
          <h2>Email marketing</h2>
          <p>We offer electronic newsletters to which you may voluntarily subscribe at any time. We are committed to
            keeping
            your e-mail address confidential and will not disclose your email address to any third parties except as
            allowed
            in the information use and processing section. We will maintain the information sent via e-mail in
            accordance
            with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
          <p>In compliance with the CAN-SPAM Act, all e-mails sent from us will clearly state who the e-mail is from and
            provide clear information on how to contact the sender.</p>
          <h2>Links to other resources</h2>
          <p>The Website and Services contain links to other resources that are not owned or controlled by us. Please be
            aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other resources or third parties. We
            encourage you to be aware when you leave the Website and Services and to read the privacy statements of each
            and
            every resource that may collect Personal Information.</p>
          <h2>Information security</h2>
          <p>We secure information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
            unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. We maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical
            safeguards in an effort to protect against unauthorized access, use, modification, and disclosure of
            Personal
            Information in its control and custody. However, no data transmission over the Internet or wireless network
            can
            be guaranteed. Therefore, while we strive to protect your Personal Information, you acknowledge that (i)
